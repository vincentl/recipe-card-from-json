      "instructions": [
        "Slide the cooled cake out of the pan onto a clean counter, keeping the parchment underneath. Use a cake ring to cut out 2 rounds from the cake for the top layers. The remaining cake will be used for the bottom layer.",
        "Clean the cake ring and place it in the center of the cake board. Line the inside of the ring with a strip of acetate.",
        "Put the cake scraps together inside the ring and use the back of your hand to tamp the scraps together into a flat even layer.",
        "Dunk a pastry brush in the Ovaltine™ soak and give the layer of cake a good, healthy bath of one-third of the soak.",
        "Use the back of a spoon to spread one-half of the malt fudge sauce in an even layer over the cake.",
        "Sprinkle one-third of the malted milk crumbs and one-half of the charred marshmallows evenly over the malt fudge sauce.",
        "Use the back of a spoon to spread one-third of the malt frosting as evenly as possible over the crumbs and marshmallows.",
        "Set a cake round on top of the frosting, and repeat the process from the first layer.",
        "Nestle the remaining cake round into the frosting. Brush with the soak and cover the top of the cake with the remaining frosting. Garnish the frosting with the remaining malt crumbs.",
        "Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap, then freeze for at least 12 hours to set the cake and filling; it will keep frozen for up to two weeks.",
        "At least 3 hours before serving, remove the cake from the freezer. Slide it out of the ring, peel away the acetate, and transfer to a platter or cake stand. Defrost in the fridge for at least 3 hours. The finished cake can be stored, well wrapped, in the fridge for up to 5 days."

        ["unsalted butter at room temperature", "230 grams"],
        ["granulated sugar", "450 grams"],
        ["light brown sugar", "120 grams"],
        ["eggs", "6 large"],
        ["buttermilk", "220 grams"],
        ["neutral oil", "210 grams"],
        ["vanilla extract", "10 grams"],
        ["cake flour", "308 grams"],
        ["cocoa powder", "140 grams"],
        ["baking powder", "12 grams"],
        ["kosher salt", "14 grams"]
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Combine the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs, and mix on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more.",
        "On low speed, stream in the buttermilk, oil, and vanilla. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and paddle for 4 to 6 minutes, until the mixture is much lighter in color, twice the size of your original fluffy butter-and-sugar mixture, and completely homogeneous. Don’t rush the process. You’re basically forcing too much liquid into an already fatty mixture that doesn’t want to make room for the liquid. There should be no streaks of fat or liquid. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "On low speed, add the cake flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Mix for 45 to 60 seconds, just until your batter comes together and any remnants of dry ingredients have been incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "Spray a 13 \u00d7 18-inch sheet pan with cooking spray and line with parchment. Using a spatula, spread the cake batter in an even layer in the pan. Give the bottom of your cake pan a tap on the countertop to even out the layer.",
        "Bake the cake for 30-35 minutes. The cake will rise and puff, rising to the top of the sheet pan. At 30 minutes, gently poke the edge of the cake with your finger: The cake should bounce back slightly and the center should no longer be jiggly. Leave the cake in the oven for an extra 3 to 5 minutes if it doesn’t pass these tests.",
        "Take the cake out of the oven and cool on a wire rack or, in a pinch, in the fridge or freezer (don’t worry, it’s not cheating). The cooled cake can be stored in the fridge, wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 5 days."
