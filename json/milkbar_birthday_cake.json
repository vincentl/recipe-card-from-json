        "Slide the cooled cake out of the pan onto a clean counter, keeping the parchment underneath. Use a cake ring to cut out 2 rounds from the cake for the top layers. The remaining cake will be used for the bottom layer.",
        "Clean the cake ring and place it in the center of the cake board. Line the inside of the ring with a strip of acetate.",
        "Put the cake scraps together inside the ring and use the back of your hand to tamp the scraps together into a flat even layer.",
        "Dunk a pastry brush in the birthday cake soak and give the layer of cake a good, healthy bath of one-third of the soak.",
        "Use the back of a spoon to spread one-fifth of the frosting in an even layer over the cake.",
        "Sprinkle one-third of the birthday crumbs evenly over the frosting. Use the back of your hand to anchor them in place.",
        "Use the back of a spoon to spread a second fifth of the birthday cake frosting as evenly as possible over the crumbs.",
        "Set a cake round on top of the frosting, and repeat the process from the first layer.",
        "Nestle the remaining cake round into the frosting. Brush with the soak and cover the top of the cake with the remaining frosting. Garnish the frosting with the remaining birthday crumbs.",
        "Wrap the cake tightly in plastic wrap, then freeze for at least 12 hours to set the cake and filling; it will keep frozen for up to two weeks.",
        "At least 3 hours before serving, remove the cake from the freezer. Slide it out of the ring, peel away the acetate, and transfer to a platter or cake stand. Defrost in the fridge for at least 3 hours. The finished cake can be stored, well wrapped, in the fridge for up to 5 days."

Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs, and mix on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more.",
        "On low speed, stream in the buttermilk, oil, and vanilla. increase the mixer speed to medium-high and paddle for 4 to 6 minutes, until the mixture is practically white, twice the size of your original fluffy butter-and-sugar mixture, and completely homogeneous. Don’t rush the process. You’re basically forcing too much liquid into an already fatty mixture that doesn’t want to make room for that liquid. There should be no streaks of fat or liquid. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "On very low speed, add the cake flour, baking powder, salt, and the 100 grams rainbow sprinkles. Mix for 45 to 60 seconds, just until your batter comes together. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "Spray a 13 \u00d7 18-inch sheet pan with cooking spray and line it parchment. Using a spatula, spread the cake batter in an even layer in the pan. Sprinkle the remaining 50 grams rainbow sprinkles evenly on top of the batter.",
        "Bake the cake for 30 to 35 minutes. The cake will rise and puff, doubling in size, but will remain slightly buttery and dense. At 30 minutes, gently poke the edge of the cake with your finger: the cake should bounce back slightly and the center should no longer be jiggly. Leave the cake in the oven for an extra 3 to 5 minutes if it doesn't pass these tests. Cool on a wire rack."

It should look just like it came out of a plastic tub at the grocery store! Use the frosting immediately, or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week."
