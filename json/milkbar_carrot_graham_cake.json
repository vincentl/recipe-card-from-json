        ["Butter, room temp", "230 grams"],
        ["Light brown sugar", "240 grams"],
        ["Granulated sugar", "200 grams"],
        ["Eggs", "4 large"],
        ["Neutral oil", "80 grams"],
        ["Flour", "400 grams"],
        ["Baking powder", "8 grams"],

      "instructions": [
        "Heat the oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Combine the butter and sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream together on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, add the eggs, and mix on medium-high for another 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once more.",
        "On low speed, stream in the oil. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and mix for 4 to 6 minutes, until the mixture is pale, nearly white, and has doubled in volume, with no streaks of fat remaining. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "On very low speed, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Mix for 45 to 60 seconds, just until the batter comes together and no dry ingredients remain. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "Remove the bowl from the mixer. Add the shredded carrots and fold them into the batter with a spatula until evenly incorporated.",
        "Spray a 13 \u00d7 18-inch sheet pan with cooking spray and line with parchment. Spread the cake batter evenly in the pan with a spatula.",
        "Bake the cake for 25 to 30 minutes. The cake will rise and puff, doubling in size, but will remain slightly buttery and dense. At 25 minutes, gently press the edge of the cake with your finger: it should spring back slightly and the center should no longer be jiggly. If not, bake for an additional 3 to 5 minutes.",
        "Cool the cake on a wire rack. To speed cooling, place the pan in the fridge or freezer. Once cool, the cake can be stored wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge for up to 5 days."

        "In a medium bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and salt. Slowly whisk in the milk, then whisk in the eggs until the mixture is smooth and homogeneous.",
        "With the mixer on medium-low speed, stream in the egg mixture. Mix for 3 to 4 minutes, until smooth and loose. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "Line the bottom and sides of a 9 \u00d7 13-inch baking pan with parchment. Pour in the cheesecake batter. Bake for 15 minutes, then gently shake the pan. The cheesecake should be set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center. If it is underbaked, continue baking in 5-minute increments, but remove immediately if it rises more than 1/4 inch or begins to brown. Total bake time should not exceed 25 minutes.",
        "Cool the cheesecake completely to finish setting. The texture should be spreadable and pliable, but still hold its shape. Once cool, store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week. Whisk to a smooth texture before layering in the final cake."
